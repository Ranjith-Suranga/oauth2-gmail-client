# OAuth2 Gmail Client

A simple Gmail client SPA to demonstrate the usage of OAuth2 with Gmail APIs. When the user authorizes, the application shows the user's inbox where he can __only read his/her emails__. The purpose of this application to demonstrate the usage of OAuth2. Because this is an Angular SPA, here it uses the __OAuth2 Implicit Flow Grant type__. Furthermore, this project has been developed as an assignment of my MSc's Software Security Module. 

Hope someone finds this helpful someday...! :wink:
